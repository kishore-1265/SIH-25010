## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
The proposed solution is to develop an AI-driven multilingual mobile application and chatbot that provides personalized, real-time crop advisory services. The platform will:

Integrate soil data, weather forecasts, and crop history for smart recommendations.

Offer voice-enabled interactions for farmers with limited literacy.

Support multiple Indian languages for inclusivity.

Provide image-based pest and disease detection through AI models.

Suggest fertilizer usage tailored to soil reports.

Track market prices and notify farmers about the best time to sell produce.

Ensure offline access with periodic syncing to help farmers in low-connectivity regions.

## Technical Approach
Data Collection & Integration:

Weather APIs (IMD, OpenWeather).

Soil data from government databases or farmer input.

Market price data from Agri-markets.

AI & ML Models:

Pest/disease detection via computer vision (CNN models).

Yield prediction using machine learning (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

NLP-based chatbot with multilingual support.

Mobile App Development:

Android-first approach (as most farmers use low-cost smartphones).

Voice-enabled features (Google Speech-to-Text).

Simple UI/UX for farmers with minimal digital literacy.

Backend & Infrastructure:

Cloud-based deployment (AWS/Azure/GCP).

Scalable APIs for data delivery.

SMS/IVR fallback for non-smartphone users.

## Feasibility and Viability
Technical Feasibility: Mobile internet penetration is high in rural India, and low-cost smartphones are common. Open-source AI/ML tools and government APIs make the solution technically achievable.

Economic Viability: Development can be supported by government schemes and agri-tech partnerships. The solution reduces input costs for farmers and improves yields, ensuring long-term adoption.

Social Viability: Multilingual and voice-enabled features ensure inclusivity for all farmers, irrespective of literacy level.


## Impact and Benefits
For Farmers: Higher yields, reduced costs, better market access, improved income.

For Government: Data-driven agriculture planning, improved farmer welfare, sustainable practices.

For Society: Food security, reduced chemical overuse, environmental conservation.

For Economy: Boost to agri-tech startups and rural digital transformation
